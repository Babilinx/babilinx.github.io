Welcome here! I'm Bastien (aka Babilinx/Papilinux), a French FOSS and tech enthousiast.

Here you will find posts about a lot of things: Linux distros reviews (I use [VanillaOS](https://vanillaos.org/) BTW), Linux tips and tricks, personal development, and some other stuff that I want to say.

If you want to know more about me, checkout the [about](about) page.
